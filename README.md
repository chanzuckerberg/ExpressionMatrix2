# ExpressionMatrix2

This repository contains software for analysis, visualization, and clustering of gene expression data from single-cell RNA sequencing developed at [Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com).
It scales favorably to large numbers of cells thank to its use of Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), and was successfully used, without downsampling, on a data set with over one million cells.

Documentation for the latest version of this software is available online through [GitHub Pages](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/ExpressionMatrix2/doc/index.html), or you can use the directions below to obtain documentation for any previous release.  

## Getting started

Detailed information to help you get started using this software is available 
[here](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/ExpressionMatrix2/doc/GettingStarted.html).

## A case study
For a detailed description of an application to a small data set of real data, see 
[here](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/ExpressionMatrix2/doc/CaseStudy1/index.html).
The screenshot below is from that case study.
